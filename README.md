# Encrypted off-site backup of Proxmox VE vzdump images for $5/month/TB

This plugin to `vzdump` will hook into after a single VM backup is done.
It will 
- split the `.vma.lzo` file that `vzdump` wrote to chunks of configurable size
  (default is 2 GB, B2 allows up to 5 GB=5*10^9 byte)
- encrypt them using a symmetric key (password - no GPG keys used),
- upload them to Backblaze B2 to a configurable path (default: hostname)
  under a configurable bucket in parallel,
- delete the local copy of the backup and
- remove all remote backups at B2 except the one it just uploaded.

Every step is checksummed and the checksum file is uploaded as well.

After all chunk uploads are finished, **the local copy of the backup is deleted**.
Therefore you only need twice the size of the largest VM's backup file
on the host. The backup is read and written multiple times, so using different
storage devices for VMs and backup is a good idea.

## Preparation

1. Get a Backblaze account and generate an application key along with a bucket.
1. Install git and download this repository:

     ```
     apt-get install -y git
     git clone https://github.com/ozerugae/vzdump-plugin-b2 /usr/local/bin/vzdump-plugin-b2
     ```

   Alternatively transfer it manually to the server.
1. Provide a *recent* version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/):

     ```
     wget -O /usr/local/bin/jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.5/jq-linux64
     chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jq
     ```

1. Make a copy of `upload-b2.config.template` and edit it to your parameters.
   If you put it anywhere else than the filename `upload-b2.config` in the
   same directory as `vzdump-plugin-upload-b2.sh`, also edit that script and
   make `CONFIG_FILE` point to it.
1. In that config file, note GPG_PASSPHRASE_FILE. That should point to a
   file containing your long, random and secret passphrase. You can use this
   do generate one:


     ```
     test -r /root/vzdump-passphrase.txt || dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=48 2>/dev/null | hexdump -v -e '"%02X"' > /root/vzdump-passphrase.txt
     ```

   **Remember and save that string** - your backups are unusable without it!
1. Make `vzdump` aware of the script by adding a line to `/etc/vzdump.conf`:

     ```
     echo "script: /usr/local/bin/vzdump-plugin-b2/vzdump-plugin-upload-b2.sh" >> /etc/vzdump.conf
     ```

1. Make available the `b2` command-line utility as documented [here](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/quick_command_line.html):

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool.git
     cd B2_Command_Line_Tool
     python setup.py install
     ```

## Testing

A manual backup of a small VM is a good idea to test general functionality.
Look at the log output for hints what may have gone wrong.
